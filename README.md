# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

The purpose of the analysis is to provide ***Accountability Accounting*** an investment profolio of currently of currently traded cryptocurrencies. We will be using data from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist) in order to perfrom a an unsupervised Machine Learning model which will enable us to perfrom a clustering algorithm in order to group these cryptocurriencies together for a new investment opportunity. 

## Libraries 
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly 
- hvPlot
- Pandas

## Software 
- Python 3 
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook 

## Application 

- Data Processing : Selection, transformation, scaling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
- Clustering Algorithms: Applied the K means algorithm, which essentially groups similar datapoints together 
- Visualization 

## Results 

The original dataset contained 1,252 entries

532 of the total entries were tradable

Our ***Elbow Curve*** method showed a slope of 4, thus we used that number of clusters for the k means algorithm
